 In each case it will be either True or False. Once you have the answers written down, you will start Python in your Terminal and type each logic problem in to confirm your answers.

True and True
False and True
1 == 1 and 2 == 1
"test" == "test"
1 == 1 or 2 != 1
True and 1 == 1
False and 0 != 0
True or 1 == 1
"test" == "testing"
1 != 0 and 2 == 1
"test" != "testing"
"test" == 1
not (True and False)
not (1 == 1 and 0 != 1)
not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000)
not (1 != 10 or 3 == 4)
not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy")
1 == 1 and (not ("testing" == 1 or 1 == 0))
"chunky" == "bacon" and (not (3 == 4 or 3 == 3))
3 == 3 and (not ("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun"))
I will also give you a trick to help you figure out the more complicated ones toward the end.

Whenever you see these boolean logic statements, you can solve them easily by this simple process:

Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
Find each not and invert it.
Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
When you are done you should have True or False.
